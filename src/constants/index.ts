//about section

export const aboutText = `Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hari Mohan, and I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My career journey began in the engineering field, where I gained diverse experiences that honed my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and collaborative mindset.

Over time, I discovered my passion for technology and its transformative potential, which led me to self-learn and dive deep into the world of Full Stack Development. Driven by curiosity and determination, I have transitioned into the IT sector, equipping myself with expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and clean architecture principles.

Today, I am passionate about building intuitive, efficient, and scalable applications that create meaningful user experiences. Whether it's crafting the frontend or designing robust backend systems, I thrive on solving challenges and bringing ideas to life.`
